### A prompt-based playlist generator!

Hi! I'm super excited for this project cause it's allowing me to explore some more NLP stuff. Synsong is an application
that will generate a playlist based on a text prompt! It's still in the works, but here's a list of features.

- [x] 1-3 line text prompt analysis
- [ ] large text analysis (using topic modeling?)
- [x] use musixmatch API with refined and complete search
- [x] log in with Spotify to generate a playlist on your account
- [x] genre specification
- [ ] genre detection
- [x] website ([synsong.app](https://synsong.app))

## Anyways...
